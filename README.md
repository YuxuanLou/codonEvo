# codonEvo
A Codon Optimization Tool Based on Pretrained Language Models

CodonEvo, through its two major modules CodonNAT and CodonEXP, learns the codon usage preferences of endogenous proteins within the host species and the latent features of highly expressed CDS sequences. It guides the codon optimization of heterologous proteins in the host species for “high naturalness” and “high expression levels” using a genetic algorithm.
